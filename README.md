# Distance Estimation using YOLOv8

This project is designed to estimate the distance between a target object and a camera using the YOLOv8s model. It tracks the bounding box of a user-specified ID throughout a video and calculates the distance based on the height of the bounding box. 

Users need to provide the height of the object, the focal length of the camera, and the ID of the bounding box. The script generates a graph of the estimated distances and outputs a CSV file that records the corresponding video frames and distance data.
