# Distance Estimation using YOLOv8

## Introduction
The project aims to estimate the distance between target object and camera using YOLOv8s
It tracks down the bounding box with user-specified ID throughout the video and estimated the distance using the height of the bounding box.
The height, the focal length of the camera and the ID of bounding box are specified by user.
